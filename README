Testing out ideas for a CBZ comics reader that would have a nice UI written in
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with a healthy dose of jQuery) and a very simple
server API.

Note: There are a couple of comics in the war/comics directory that I'm using
for testing. Both are out of copyright, see (http://digitalcomicmuseum.com/) for
more information and other golden age comics that never had their copyrights
renewed.
